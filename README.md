# Project: Simple Responsive Landing Page

## 1. What I Did

This project is a clean, professional, and fully responsive landing page built for a fictional company called "ElevateLabs". The goal was to create a modern-looking webpage that meets all the core requirements of a standard landing page, including a header, a hero section to grab attention, a features area, and a footer.

The page is designed to be "believably built by an intern" â€” it uses straightforward, modern techniques without being overly complex. It's clean, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.

## 2. Code Used

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the webpage.
* **Tailwind CSS:** For all styling. Instead of a separate `style.css` file, I used the Tailwind CSS CDN. This allows for rapid development using utility classes directly in the HTML, which is a very modern and popular workflow. All the responsiveness (for mobile, tablet, and desktop) is handled by Tailwind's responsive prefixes (like `md:`).
* **JavaScript:** A tiny bit of vanilla JavaScript is included at the bottom of the page to handle the opening and closing of the mobile navigation menu (the "hamburger" menu).

## 3. How to Run

No special tools or servers are needed.

1.  Save the code as an `index.html` file.
2.  Double-click the file to open it in any modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).

The page will display perfectly, and you can test its responsiveness by resizing the browser window.

## 4. Screenshots

(No screenshots are included in the code, but you can easily take them by opening the `index.html` file and capturing the screen on desktop and mobile views using your browser's developer tools.)
